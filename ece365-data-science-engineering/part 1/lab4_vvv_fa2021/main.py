        Do NOT change the random seed, otherwise we are not able to grade your code! This is true throughout this script. However, in practice, you never want to set a random seed like this.
        For your own interest, after you have finished implementing this function, you can change the seed to different values and check your results.
        Please use numpy library for initial random choice. This will use the seed above. Scipy library is using a different seeding system, so that would probably result in an error during our grading.

        1. data     (N, d) numpy ndarray. The unlabelled data with each row as a feature vector.
        2. K        Integer. It indicates the number of clusters.

        1. labels   (N,) numpy array. It contains which cluster (0,...,K-1) a feature vector is in. It should be the (niter+1)-th assignment.

        """ Return the RSS from the Lasso regression.

        Apply lasso regression with sklearn.linear_model.Lasso. Sweep the regularization/tuning parameter Î± = 0,...,1 with 1000 equally spaced values.

        Note: Larger values of Î± will lead to sparser solutions (i.e. less features used in the model), with a sufficiently large value of Î± leading to a constant prediction. Small values of Î± are closer to the LS solution, with Î±=0 being the LS solution.

        Parameters:
        1. trainfeat    (Nt, d) numpy ndarray. The features in the training set.
        2. trainresp    (Nt,) numpy array. The responses in the training set.
        3. valfeat      (Nv, d) numpy ndarray. The features in the validation set.
        4. valresp      (Nv,) numpy array. The responses in the validation set.

        Outputs:
        1. rss_array    (1000,). The validation RSS array. This is used for plotting. This will not be tested by the autograder.
        2. best_a       Scalar. The alpha that minimizes the RSS.
        3. best_rss     Scalar. The corresponding RSS.
        4. coef         (d,) numpy array. The minimizing coefficient. This is for visualization only. This will not be tested by the autograder.
